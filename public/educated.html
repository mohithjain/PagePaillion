<b>Summary</b><br>
"Educated" by Tara Westover is a captivating memoir that chronicles the author's extraordinary journey from a secluded and unconventional upbringing to academic achievement and self-discovery. Born in 1986 in rural Idaho, Westover grew up in a strict and survivalist household, isolated from mainstream society.
